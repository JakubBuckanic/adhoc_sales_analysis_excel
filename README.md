# README: Ad-Hoc Analysis Excel File

## Overview
This Excel file is designed to provide insights into the performance of different suppliers, brands, and categories in a fitness equipment market. It includes raw data as well as several key visualizations and analyses for profit tracking, market share, and moving annual totals.

### 0. Raw Data
The raw data serves as the backbone for all calculations and visualizations. It includes information on:
- **Supplier**: The company supplying the products.
- **Brand**: The brand under each supplier.
- **Category**: The type of fitness equipment (e.g., Rowing Machine, Airbike, Treadmill).
- **Year**
- **Month**
- **Profit**: Monthly profit values used for analysis.

### 1. Supplier-Brand-Category Breakdown
The first visualization breaks down the **Supplier**, **Brand**, and **Category**. It provides a hierarchical view of the product structure:
- **Supplier**: Parent category representing the overall supplier.
- **Brand**: Subcategory under each supplier.
- **Category**: The type of fitness equipment each brand sells.

This visualization offers a clear look at the product offerings from each supplier and brand, helping users quickly identify which brands are aligned with which product categories.

### 2. Profit Change by Supplier and Brand
This visualization tracks the **profit change** over time, organized by:
- **Supplier**: Top-level grouping.
- **Brand**: Subcategory under each supplier.

The goal of this view is to:
- Highlight how profits have changed for each supplier.
- Show brand-specific performance under each supplier.
- Identify profit trends and fluctuations across different time periods.

This view can help stakeholders evaluate how well specific suppliers and their associated brands are performing in terms of profitability.

### 3. Market Share (Brand) with Slicer by Category
The **market share** visualization shows how different brands contribute to the overall market share within each category of fitness equipment. This dashboard includes:
- A **slicer** to filter by **Category** (e.g., Treadmill, Airbike, Rowing Machine).
- A visual representation of market share distribution across brands.

This analysis is essential for understanding the relative performance of brands in various categories. The slicer allows users to explore market share insights for individual product categories.

### 4. Moving Annual Total with Year and Month Filter
The **Moving Annual Total (MAT)** tracks the cumulative profit over a 12-month period. This visualization includes:
- A **filter** to adjust the view by **Year** and **Month**.
- The moving total helps to smooth out monthly fluctuations and provides a clearer view of long-term profit trends.

This is particularly useful for understanding overall business performance and identifying any seasonal patterns or trends over the course of the year.
